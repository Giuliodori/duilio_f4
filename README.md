# DUILIO F4 — Motion Control Board

***The wheel is already made, Duilio makes it move the right way.***


📩 **info@duilio-project.it** · 🌐 **https://duilio.cc**

You already have motors and drivers.  
What’s missing is **reliable and coordinated motion control behavior**.

DUILIO F4 is a **robust STM32-based motion control development board** with ready-to-use firmware and built-in safety logic.

Duilio F4 interfaces with control sources (RC receivers, PCs, Raspberry Pi or SBCs) and **any external motor driver**, embedding motion logic that usually gets reinvented every time: ramps, limits, coordination and failsafe.

## Intended use

Duilio F4 is a **development board** intended for **makers, advanced hobbyists and developers**,  
designed for **prototyping, experimentation and motion-control architecture development**.
While designed as a development board, Duilio F4 is intended to be used as a **finished motion controller** in real machines.


---

## What can you build with Duilio F4?

- **RC vehicles and machines**  
  Cars, boats, tracked vehicles, robotic platforms, remote lawn mowers.

- **Robots and mechatronic systems**  
  Differential drive, skid-steer, articulated mechanisms, linear actuators.

- **Custom servo motors of any power**  
  Turn **any motor + any driver** into a servo-like axis with limits, ramps and safety.

- **Rugged motion systems inspired by industrial practices**
  Consistent motion behavior using inexpensive or industrial drivers.


## Motors and drivers

Duilio F4 is **motor-agnostic** and **driver-agnostic**.  
If a driver can be controlled via **PWM, DIR, analog or RC-style signals**, Duilio F4 can manage it.

## Why Duilio F4?

Driving a motor is easy.  
Making a machine **behave predictably and safely** is not.

Duilio F4 removes the need to reinvent motion control logic, turning simple motor drivers into **motion-controller–like systems** — without writing custom application firmware.

**If you already have a motor driver, Duilio F4 makes it real motion control.**

By handling motion logic and safety on-board, Duilio F4 often results in a **lower total system cost** compared to generic controllers:
- fewer external boards
- less custom firmware
- simpler wiring
- faster time to a working machine


---

## Example wiring — PWM/DIR motor driver (ZS-X11 style)

The diagram below shows a **typical and minimal wiring** between Duilio F4 and a PWM/DIR motor driver  
(ZS-X11–style logic, ENABLE + DIR + PWM).

This configuration applies to **many common motor drivers**, not only ZS-X11.

</p>

**Notes:**
- ENABLE is strongly recommended for failsafe behavior  
- PWM frequency and logic level are configurable  
- The same wiring concept applies to many industrial and hobby drivers

---

## Example wiring — Servo-style / Dual-PWM driver with closed-loop positioning  
### (BTS7960 / IBT-2 + dual I²C absolute encoders)

This example shows a **closed-loop positioning setup** using Duilio F4 with:

- **servo-style / dual-PWM motor drivers** (BTS7960 / IBT-2 style)
- **two absolute I²C 14-bit encoders (MT6701)**  
- **on-board PID control** for precise positioning

Each motor axis is equipped with its own absolute encoder, allowing:
- precise position feedback
- repeatable homing without mechanical end-stops
- stable PID-controlled motion

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/schema_servo_bts6970.svg" width="90%">
</p>

**Encoder details:**
- Type: **MT6701 absolute magnetic encoder**
- Resolution: **14-bit (16384 positions per revolution)**
- Interface: **I²C**
- Each axis uses one dedicated encoder

**Notes:**
- Forward and reverse motion are handled by **two PWM signals**
- ENABLE remains available as a **global safety gate**
- PID loop runs **locally on Duilio**, independent of the host
- Positioning accuracy depends on mechanical transmission and encoder mounting

## Core design principles
- **Driver-agnostic architecture**
- **Profile-based configuration (instead of custom code)**
- **Robust and deterministic communication**
- **Fail-safe oriented behavior**
- **Scalable multi-board systems**

## System architecture

Duilio F4 can operate as a **standalone motion controller** or as part of a **host-controlled system**.

It can be driven by:
- RC receivers
- Raspberry Pi and other SBCs (Orange Pi, Rock Pi, Jetson Nano, …)
- standard PCs or industrial computers

When a host is present, Duilio F4 handles **deterministic real-time motion control and I/O**, while the host focuses on high-level logic, UI, networking or supervision.
