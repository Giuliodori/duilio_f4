# DUILIO F4 — Motion Control Board
**After the wheel, real motion control.**
Turning simple motor drivers into reliable, coordinated motion systems.

In robotics and mechatronics, the real challenge is not driving motors,
but turning simple motor drivers into reliable, coordinated and safe motion systems.

Duilio F4 solves this problem by **removing the need to reinvent control logic**:
it transforms basic, rugged or industrial motor drivers into advanced motion controllers
**without writing custom control firmware**.

Duilio F4 is a **ready-to-use motion control board** that sits between
control sources (RC receivers, PCs, Raspberry Pi and other SBCs)
and **external motor drivers**, adding intelligence, coordination and safety.

It is **not a generic development board**.
Duilio F4 combines robust hardware, pre-developed firmware
and a dedicated configuration tool (**Duilio Tools**)
to configure motors and I/O **without writing application code**.

Instead of forcing a specific motor topology or power stage,
Duilio F4 lets you choose the most suitable external driver
(PWM/DIR, analog, RC-style or industrial interfaces)
and adapts the control behavior through **predefined control profiles**.

This allows inexpensive, rugged or industrial drivers
to behave like fully featured motion controllers,
with acceleration ramps, limits, mixers, positioning logic and failsafe handling.


---

## Status
- **Hardware**: Third-generation prototype, multiple production iterations completed
- **Firmware**: Actively developed and tested on real hardware
- **Duilio Tools**: Operational and in active use, currently being adapted to the new 64-pin STM32 platform

Documentation and software are published progressively as hardware validation advances.

---

## Core design principles
- **Driver-agnostic architecture**
- **Profile-based configuration (instead of custom code)**
- **Robust and deterministic communication**
- **Fail-safe oriented behavior**
- **Scalable multi-board systems**

---

## System architecture
Duilio F4 can be controlled by:
- Raspberry Pi
- single-board computers (Orange Pi, Rock Pi, Jetson Nano, …)
- standard PCs or industrial computers

In host-controlled configurations, Duilio F4 handles real-time motion control and I/O, while the host provides high-level logic, UI, or networking.

---

## Motor control
Duilio F4 is designed to turn **simple, robust and cost-effective drivers** into **fully featured motion control systems**.

### Supported / supportable driver interfaces
- **PWM / DIR**
- **PWM forward / PWM reverse (PWMF / PWMR)**
- **ENABLE + DIR + PWM**
- **dual-PWM speed control**
- **STEP / DIR** (speed-based or position-based usage)
- **analog speed** (0–5V)
- **analog speed + direction**
- **RC-style PWM** (servo pulses / ESCs)
- **serial / protocol-based drivers** (profile-dependent)

### Motion features (profile-dependent)
- acceleration / deceleration ramps
- speed limiting and soft limits
- motion mixing (e.g. differential drive, coordinated axes)
- position control and positioning logic
- safety behaviors, interlocks and failsafe actions

### Position feedback (profile-dependent)
- relative position tracking
- absolute position sensing
- external encoders or sensors
- hybrid approaches (combined sources)

All behavior is defined through **control profiles** (interfaces, scaling, limits, dynamics, safety, optional telemetry/feedback handling).

---

## Power supply and system integration
Duilio F4 simplifies power distribution in robotic systems.

### Power inputs
- **VIN**: **6 V to 43 V**
- **5 V from USB**
- **5 V from Raspberry Pi** (HAT mode)

The board automatically manages active sources and prevents back-feeding between VIN, USB.

### Raspberry Pi power support
- powers Raspberry Pi via GPIO
- up to **5.1 V / 5 A**
- reduces external adapters and wiring

### RC servo power distribution
- regulated servo supply for small servos/actuators
- **PTC resettable fuse (2 A)**
- direct servo control without external power modules (for small loads)

### Protection and robustness
- TVS transient suppression
- ESD protection on sensitive interfaces
- isolation/protection diodes between power domains

Designed for electrically noisy environments (motor drivers, switching regulators, long cables).

---

## Communication robustness and scalability
Supported communication options:
- **UART**
- **USB**
- **RS485** (multi-drop)

In RS485 multi-board systems:
- broadcast commands
- per-node telemetry return
- deterministic, low-latency behavior
- stable operation in harsh EMI environments

---

## Typical use cases
- mobile robots and autonomous platforms
- remote-controlled machines
- multi-axis and coordinated motion systems
- distributed robotic systems
- Raspberry Pi–based controllers
- rapid prototyping of custom machines

## Real-world inspiration
Duilio F4 is the result of hands-on experience gained while building real machines and robotic platforms.

## Duilio Tools
**Duilio Tools** is the official configuration and debugging software.

It provides:
- guided board configuration
- parameter tuning without writing firmware code
- real-time monitoring and diagnostics
- advanced graphical debugging

<div align="left">
  <img src="docs/images/duilio-tools_1.png" style="display:block; margin:auto; width:95%;">
</div>

Duilio Tools is designed so that **even users without specific programming knowledge** can configure and use the board effectively.
Advanced users remain free to bypass the tool and work directly with the firmware.

## What Duilio F4 is not
- not a high-power motor driver
- no integrated motor power stages
- no fixed control architecture

Duilio F4 sits between control sources and power electronics, providing motion logic, safety, scaling and coordination.
