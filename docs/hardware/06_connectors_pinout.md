This section lists all external connectors of the DUILIO F4.
Pin numbering follows the board silkscreen.
Signal direction and electrical limits are reported in the "Notes" column.
The electrical limits indicated per pin are subject to total current constraints of the board power system.

> NOTE: Power distribution and current limits (system-level)
> - Individual pin current ratings are maximum limits, not guarantees.
> - The sum of all output currents depends on the active power source.
> - When powered from VIN: total available 5 V current approx. 3 A continuous, 5 A peak (shared).
> - When powered ONLY from USB or Raspberry Pi GPIO: total available 5 V current < 0.8 A.
> - Exceeding the total budget may cause voltage drop, reset, or thermal shutdown.
