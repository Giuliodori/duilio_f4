# 2. Features & Specifications

## 2.1 Electrical specifications
Table 2-1 - Electrical specifications

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main supply input (VIN range) | 6-43 V DC | Primary supply input for board and power distribution; use a regulated DC source. |
| Logic voltage levels | Separate 5 V and 3.3 V domains | Use peripherals compatible with the respective logic domain. |
| Power distribution concept | Central VIN distribution with local regulation for logic rails | Provide external protection and current limiting as appropriate. |
| External power dependency | Depends on connected loads and external drivers | Output power availability is defined by the external supply and driver stages. |
